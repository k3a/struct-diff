NixOS is a Linux distribution with its own unique package manager.

The entire operating system, including the kernel, applications, system
packages and configuration files, are built by the Nix package manager.

The Nix Package Manager uses a declarative system configuration model.
This means system configuration items are described in a configuration
file and the OS does everything necessary to make the configuration happen.

This declarative nature allows for reliable system upgrades and makes
the system reproducible, which means that it is simple to have
the exact same system with all of the favorite applications
available on multiple computers.
